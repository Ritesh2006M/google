## Overview 📖
Teachers worldwide are overburdened with manual grading and struggle to provide personalized feedback, especially in large or under-resourced classrooms. This limits their ability to mentor effectively and deprives students of tailored guidance essential for learning.

**Score Lab** is an AI-powered platform that automates student answer script evaluation using the **Gemini API** 🤖. Teachers upload question papers and students submit answers as PDFs, which are analyzed by AI to deliver accurate scores and detailed feedback instantly. By streamlining the evaluation process, Score Lab saves time ⏱️, reduces teacher workload, and enhances student learning outcomes, aligning with **UN SDG 4: Quality Education** 🌍.
